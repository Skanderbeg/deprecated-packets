Deprecated Quizbowl Packet Database
----------

This repository was meant to be a central repository for questions, but that never actually ended up happening because learning to use Git is kind of an unreasonable expectation for people who just want to upload packets. Anyway, tune in for the next version of the protobowl packets editor which will eventually happen, hopefully moreso than the last eventually.

----------

This is going to be the central repository for Protobowl questions in the next major release. This means that you can add your own questions by creating a folder and formatting the questions. It also means that people can update existing ones in a somewhat wiki style.
